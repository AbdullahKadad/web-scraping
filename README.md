# Web Scraping

Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites automatically. It involves retrieving web content, parsing the data, and often storing it in a structured format for further analysis or usage.

## How Web Scraping Works

1. **HTTP Requests:** A web scraper sends HTTP requests to a target website to fetch web pages, typically using libraries like `requests` in Python.
2. **Parsing HTML:** The fetched web page is then parsed to extract relevant data. Libraries like BeautifulSoup or lxml are commonly used for this purpose.
3. **Data Extraction:** The desired data, which can include text, images, links, tables, etc., is extracted from the parsed HTML.
4. **Data Storage:** Extracted data is stored in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, a database, or other formats suitable for analysis or further processing.
